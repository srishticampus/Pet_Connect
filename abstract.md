**PET CONNECT**

# **Abstract: PetConnect – A Platform for Pet Adoption, Fostering, and Rescue**

Every year, countless animals are abandoned or lost, and finding them a safe and loving home can be challenging. Many rescue organizations struggle to connect with potential adopters and fosters, while pet owners seeking help for lost pets often lack a centralized platform. PetConnect aims to bridge this gap by providing a structured platform that simplifies pet adoption, fosters pet care, and helps reunite lost pets with their owners. With AI/ML integration, the platform now offers automatic pet breed identification, making the adoption process easier and improving lost pet recognition.

PetConnect is an online platform designed to help people adopt and foster pets while supporting rescues and shelters in their efforts. Users can browse pet profiles, submit adoption applications, and communicate with rescues or shelters. Foster caregivers can apply to take care of pets temporarily, while pet owners can report lost or found pets. The platform ensures the credibility of shelters and provides a directory of pet-related services. Admins oversee platform activities, verify organizations, and maintain a safe and trustworthy environment. AI-powered breed identification helps users automatically detect the breed of a pet when uploading an image

# **System Analysis: PetConnect – A Platform for Pet Adoption, Fostering, and Rescue**

## **1.1 Existing System**

Currently, pet adoption and fostering rely on manual breed selection and lack automated pet identification tools, disconnected systems, such as individual shelter websites, social media groups, and word-of-mouth communication. Many organizations use manual processes or outdated websites to list available pets, making it difficult for adopters and fosters to find suitable matches. Additionally, there is no centralized platform for reporting lost and found pets, often leading to delays in reuniting pets with their owners.

### **1.1.1 Limitations of the Existing System**

* Lack of Centralization: Information is scattered across multiple platforms, making it hard for users to find what they need.  
* Limited Communication: Adopters and fosters often face delays in responses due to the lack of integrated communication tools.  
* Manual Processing: Most adoption and foster applications are handled manually, leading to inefficiencies and long waiting times.  
* Verification Issues: There is no standard process for verifying shelters and organizations, leading to potential trust issues.  
* No Dedicated Lost & Found System: Pet owners rely on social media, which is unreliable and unorganized for finding lost pets.  
* **Manual breed identification** can lead to errors and inconsistencies.
